  So only in VB6 environment it returns a VB.Form, else Nothing. (without crash)

13-May-2017
- Internal improvement on all controls concerning CausesValidation on mouse activation.
  For the ActiveX version this improvement is actually an important bugfix as it was broken there.

  VB's UserControl.ScaleX/Y with vbHimetric/vbPixel is broken on exotic or very large DPI settings.

- Internal improvement in the Slider control.
- Included the MouseEnter/MouseLeave event and MouseTrack property in the Slider control.

18-Apr-2017

  This is done by either SetWindowPos HWND_TOPMOST (created by comctl32) or directly WS_EX_TOPMOST on CreateWindowEx (own tooltip).
- The internal tooltip in the TreeView control respects now changes in the VisualStyles property.

20-Mar-2017
- Critical bugfix in the PrinterDriver/PrinterPort after user selections in the CommonDialog class.
  This might caused wrong initialization in case 'PrinterDefaultInit' is set to False.
- PrinterDriver/PrinterName/PrinterPort will be set empty when default printer (wDefault = DN_DEFAULTPRN) was selected in the CommonDialog class.
  This ensures that the default printer remains active also when it got changed in the meantime.

19-Mar-2017
- VB.Printer object is no longer used in the CommonDialog class.
  Therefore included the PrinterDriver/PrinterName/PrinterPort property which will be set
  automatically when the user selected a printer in a print dialog box.
  So even when 'PrinterDefault' is False, you can write code to print directly to the VB.Printer object in your app.
  Also included the PrinterDefaultInit property which indicates if the default (like the original MS CommonDialog)
  or user-selected printer will be initialized in a print or page setup dialog box.

18-Mar-2017
- Included the PaperSize/PaperBin property in the CommonDialog class.
  The printer dialog will now read/write to that PaperSize/PaperBin property instead of the VB.Printer object.
- When Orientation, PaperSize and/or PaperBin properties are not set explicitly in the CommonDialog class then
  the default driver settings will be used until the first printer dialog has been succesfully finished.
  If the properties are not set explicitly they will however return some "most common default values", but that
  does not necessarily mean that these are the default driver settings that will be used later on in the dialog boxes.
  This approach is the same as in the original MS CommonDialog, though the PaperSize/PaperBin are not exposed/accesible.

17-Mar-2017
- Bugfix when using flag 'CdlPDReturnDefault' in the ShowPrinterEx dialog (no bug in ShowPrinter) in the CommonDialog class.
- Included the Orientation property in the CommonDialog class. (like the original MS CommonDialog)

16-Mar-2017
- The default value of 'PrinterDefault' is now True instead of False in the CommonDialog class.
- Included the Copies property in the CommonDialog class. (like the original MS CommonDialog)
  The printer dialog will now read/write to that Copies property instead of the VB.Printer object.

21-Feb-2017
- Included the AllowOverType and OverTypeMode property in the TextBoxW control.
  The default value of AllowOverType is False. (contrary to the RichTextBox control, where default value is True)

- Included the AllowOverType and OverTypeMode property in the RichTextBox control.

14-Feb-2017
- Improved the SelPrint and PrintDoc methods in the RichTextBox control.

21-Jan-2017
- Fixed a bug that the item's checkboxes/options were not drawn grayed in a disabled non-standard Style ListBoxW control.

20-Jan-2017
- Enhanced the Style property with '2 - Option' in the ListBoxW control.

19-Jan-2017
- Two minor bugfixes in the ListBoxW control.
  - Direct clicking the checkbox (Checkbox Style and MultiColumn set to True) was not possible when not selected before. (behavior bug)
  - If both RightToLeft and MultiColumn are set True the top index goes negative and everything is unpredictable and unstable. (MS bug?)
    Solution was to set (in that specific case) the right-to-left alignment after the control was created.

15-Jan-2017
- Included the ItemBeforeCheck event (with 'Cancel' parameter) in the ListBoxW control.
- Bugfix that the checked state was not unchecked by default of a new inserted item in a Checkbox Style ListBoxW control.
- Included X/Y parameter in the OLEGetDropEffect event in the RichTextBox control.

14-Jan-2017
- The Locked property in the ComboBoxW control works now like the original VB ComboBox.
  So, beside the locking of the edit control, the list portion is locked as well.
  The drop-down list can be shown but no item can be selected by mouse or key from the user.
  That also means that now the Locked property is available when having the style set to 'DropDownList'.
- Same ComboBoxW improvements implemented into the ImageCombo control.

13-Jan-2017

  It now also works in a multi-column list box or when doing a 'HorizontalExtent' scrolling.

  Example: 'Set TreeView1.Nodes(1).Tag = TreeView1.Object' (Though TreeView1 without '.Object' is allowed)

28-May-2016
- Shadow objects in class collections are now also decoupled in run-time controls. (ImageCombo, LinkLabel, ListView and TreeView control)

21-May-2016
- Included the NodeBeforeSelect event in the TreeView control.
- Removed the GetFirstVisible function in the TreeView, ListView and ImageCombo control.

16-May-2016
- Improved the Expanded property of a Node in the TreeView control. It works now like in the original MS control.
  It is now ensured that BeforeCollapse/BeforeExpand and Collapse/Expand events are always fired when state is being changed.

- It is now possible to pass a Node object in the Relative parameter in Nodes.Add and Node.Move in the TreeView control.
- Removed the error message 'the size of the selected picture is not compatible' in the Images property page of the ImageList control.

  The original MS control allows it also. So such error message was a unnecessary limitation.

12-May-2016
- Fixed a bug in the Move method of a Node and some other internal improvements in the TreeView control.
  Bugs were in relation to the new ExpandedImage property of a Node.

04-May-2016
- The Change event is now also fired when value was changed by code in the DTPicker control.
  Though in the original MS control it is only raised when value was changed by user.
  But that makes actually no sense and might be even a bug in the original MS control.

15-Apr-2016
- Minor adjustment to the BackColor in the StatusBar control so that the Pager control can recognize it.

31-Mar-2016
