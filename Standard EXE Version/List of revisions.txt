29-Mar-2017
- Included the MouseEnter/MouseLeave event and MouseTrack property in the LabelW control.

23-Mar-2017
- Included the PrintQuality/ColorMode/Duplex property in the CommonDialog class.
- Fixed GDI leak for 'hDC' in the CommonDialog class. (DeleteObject on Class_Terminate or new return of printer dialog)

20-Mar-2017
- Critical bugfix in the PrinterDriver/PrinterPort after user selections in the CommonDialog class.
  This might caused wrong initialization in case 'PrinterDefaultInit' is set to False.
- PrinterDriver/PrinterName/PrinterPort will be set empty when default printer (wDefault = DN_DEFAULTPRN) was selected in the CommonDialog class.
  This ensures that the default printer remains active also when it got changed in the meantime.

19-Mar-2017
- VB.Printer object is no longer used in the CommonDialog class.
  Therefore included the PrinterDriver/PrinterName/PrinterPort property which will be set
  automatically when the user selected a printer in a print dialog box.
  So even when 'PrinterDefault' is False, you can write code to print directly to the VB.Printer object in your app.
  Also included the PrinterDefaultInit property which indicates if the default (like the original MS CommonDialog)
  or user-selected printer will be initialized in a print or page setup dialog box.

18-Mar-2017
- Included the PaperSize/PaperBin property in the CommonDialog class.
  The printer dialog will now read/write to that PaperSize/PaperBin property instead of the VB.Printer object.
- When Orientation, PaperSize and/or PaperBin properties are not set explicitly in the CommonDialog class then
  the default driver settings will be used until the first printer dialog has been succesfully finished.
  If the properties are not set explicitly they will however return some "most common default values", but that
  does not necessarily mean that these are the default driver settings that will be used later on in the dialog boxes.
  This approach is the same as in the original MS CommonDialog, though the PaperSize/PaperBin are not exposed/accesible.

17-Mar-2017
- Bugfix when using flag 'CdlPDReturnDefault' in the ShowPrinterEx dialog (no bug in ShowPrinter) in the CommonDialog class.
- Included the Orientation property in the CommonDialog class. (like the original MS CommonDialog)
  The printer dialog will now read/write to that Orientation property instead of the VB.Printer object.

16-Mar-2017
- The default value of 'PrinterDefault' is now True instead of False in the CommonDialog class.
- Included the Copies property in the CommonDialog class. (like the original MS CommonDialog)
  The printer dialog will now read/write to that Copies property instead of the VB.Printer object.

21-Feb-2017
- Included the AllowOverType and OverTypeMode property in the TextBoxW control.
  The default value of AllowOverType is False. (contrary to the RichTextBox control, where default value is True)

19-Feb-2017
- Included the AllowOverType and OverTypeMode property in the RichTextBox control.

14-Feb-2017
- Improved the SelPrint and PrintDoc methods in the RichTextBox control.
  It can now also be used on a non-printer DC, e.g. DC of a PictureBox.

13-Feb-2017
- Two bugfixes in the SelPrint and PrintDoc methods in the RichtTextBox control.
  - RightMargin/BottomMargin were added to the printable area instead deducted.
  - The printable area was not converted from device units to twips. (the paper area was not wrong)

06-Feb-2017
- Bugfix in the Text property of a ComboItem in the ImageCombo control.

03-Feb-2017
- Bugfix in the RightToLeft property in the TabStrip control. (TCIF_RTLREADING now used instead of WS_EX_RTLREADING)

21-Jan-2017
- Fixed a bug that the item's checkboxes/options were not drawn grayed in a disabled non-standard Style ListBoxW control.
  On update from 18-Oct-2016 was only the text fixed to drawn grayed in that case, but not the button itself.

20-Jan-2017
- Enhanced the Style property with '2 - Option' in the ListBoxW control.
  Also included the OptionIndex run-time property.
- Included the AutoSelectFirstItem property in the ListView control. (Default is True)
  Setting to False equals MS 5.0 ListView behavior and True equals MS 6.0 ListView behavior.

19-Jan-2017
- Two minor bugfixes in the ListBoxW control.
  - Direct clicking the checkbox (Checkbox Style and MultiColumn set to True) was not possible when not selected before. (behavior bug)
  - If both RightToLeft and MultiColumn are set True the top index goes negative and everything is unpredictable and unstable. (MS bug?)
    Solution was to set (in that specific case) the right-to-left alignment after the control was created.

15-Jan-2017
- Included the ItemBeforeCheck event (with 'Cancel' parameter) in the ListBoxW control.
- Bugfix that the checked state was not unchecked by default of a new inserted item in a Checkbox Style ListBoxW control.
- Included X/Y parameter in the OLEGetDropEffect event in the RichTextBox control.

14-Jan-2017
- The Locked property in the ComboBoxW control works now like the original VB ComboBox.
  So, beside the locking of the edit control, the list portion is locked as well.
  The drop-down list can be shown but no item can be selected by mouse or key from the user.
  That also means that now the Locked property is available when having the style set to 'DropDownList'.
- Same ComboBoxW improvements implemented into the ImageCombo control.

13-Jan-2017
- 16-bit barrier for thumb scrolling circumvented in the ComboBoxW control. (like as for the ListBoxW control)
- Included the ScrollTrack property in the ComboBoxW control.
- .hWndList in the ComboBoxW control is now working on Windows 2000.
  Message CB_GETCOMBOBOXINFO is not supported on Windows 2000. (similar issue as 29-Feb-2016 update)
  Thus the message got replaced by the API GetComboBoxInfo in user32.dll.

10-Jan-2017
- Bugfix for the 32-bit thumb scrolling support in the ListBoxW control.
  It now also works in a multi-column list box or when doing a 'HorizontalExtent' scrolling.

- Renamed OLEGetDragEffect to OLEStartDrag in the RichTextBox control. (also Button/Shift parameter are removed as anyway always zero)

26-Dec-2016
- Internal improvement in the mouse events. The correct button value will be passed now in case left and right button are "swapped". (windows setting)
  It is also necessary to replace the Common.bas module. (included the GetShiftStateFromParam/GetMouseStateFromParam function)

23-Dec-2016
- Bugfix that the Click event was not fired when changing the Value property by code in the CheckBoxW and OptionButtonW control.
- Some other minor internal improvements.

21-Dec-2016
- The Resizable property of a ColumnHeader requires not anymore the comctls32.dll version 6.1 or higher in the ListView control.

  - Renamed interface IEnumeration to IEnumVARIANTUnrestricted. (like as IUnknownUnrestricted)
  - Removed interface IEnumerationVB. (obselete)
  - Correction in IDispatch.GetIDsOfNames. (rgszNames param now declared as LPWSTR)
  It is necessary to replace all components and it is recommended to unregister the old OLEGuids.tlb.

06-Dec-2016
- Bugfix that the Click event was not fired in two cases in the ListBoxW control:

  - User has clicked again on a selected item in a single-selection list box
  Reason was that the LBN_SELCANCEL notification code was missing in the event handling.

13-Nov-2016
- Bugfix in the internal ModifyButton method in the ToolBar control.
- The '&' was displayed as a normal character in a Band's caption in the CoolBar control.
  Now it will underline the character to make it as an accelerator key.

07-Jul-2016
- Image property in class collections are now as Variant.
  This allows to set a index or key of an image in an associated image list control.

  Example: 'Set TreeView1.Nodes(1).Tag = TreeView1.Object' (Though TreeView1 without '.Object' is allowed)

28-May-2016
- Shadow objects in class collections are now also decoupled in run-time controls. (ImageCombo, LinkLabel, ListView and TreeView control)

- Minor bugfixes in the TopItem property in the ListView control.

22-May-2016
- Improved the TopItem property in the ListView control.
  It can be used now also when groups are enabled in 'report' view. (LVM_GETTOPINDEX fails in this case, thus a workaround was necessary)
  Enhanced the code when in 'Icon', 'SmallIcon' and 'Tile' view.

21-May-2016
- Included the NodeBeforeSelect event in the TreeView control.
- Removed the GetFirstVisible function in the TreeView, ListView and ImageCombo control.

  When updating, please replace all components. (e.g. RichTextBoxBase.bas)

16-May-2016
- Improved the Expanded property of a Node in the TreeView control. It works now like in the original MS control.
  It is now ensured that BeforeCollapse/BeforeExpand and Collapse/Expand events are always fired when state is being changed.
  Also it is now possible to set the expanded state even when there are no child items associated.
- To support large numbers the Children property of a Node returns now 'Long' instead of 'Integer' in the TreeView control.

15-May-2016
- It is now possible to pass a Node object in the Relative parameter in Nodes.Add and Node.Move in the TreeView control.
- Removed the error message 'the size of the selected picture is not compatible' in the Images property page of the ImageList control.
  So at design time it is now allowed to select different sized pictures. At run time it was already allowed.
  The original MS control allows it also. So such error message was a unnecessary limitation.

12-May-2016
- Fixed a bug in the Move method of a Node and some other internal improvements in the TreeView control.
  Bugs were in relation to the new ExpandedImage property of a Node.

11-May-2016

  This Error is also raised in the original MS control.

04-May-2016
- The Change event is now also fired when value was changed by code in the DTPicker control.
  Though in the original MS control it is only raised when value was changed by user.
  But that makes actually no sense and might be even a bug in the original MS control.

15-Apr-2016
- Minor adjustment to the BackColor in the StatusBar control so that the Pager control can recognize it.

31-Mar-2016
- Minor bugfix in the internal Numeric/Currency/Date sorting functions in the ListView control.

- Bugfixes and improvements for vertical ToolBar control. (Align property set to vbAlignLeft or vbAlignRight)
  The Vertical ToolBar behaves now like the original MS control when the Wrappable property is set to False.
  Also changing from horizontal to vertical and vice versa after initialization works now properly.

29-Feb-2016
- All controls are now "DPI Aware". (concerns exotic DPI or very large DPI, e.g. 113% and 200%)
- ComboBoxW with Style 'CboStyleDropDownCombo' is now working on Windows 2000.
